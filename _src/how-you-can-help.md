The COVID Tracking Project was [founded by three people](https://covidtracking.com/about-team/) working very quickly to collect urgently needed data, and has grown to include over [100 volunteer contributors](https://covidtracking.com/about-team/). We are surrently sorting and welcoming a new rush of wonderful volunteers, and have briefly paused our intake form until we catch up. We plan to reopen it within 48 hours.


## Local news means local data

In the meantime, we have a request for everyone who can afford to make a financial contribution: Subscribe to your local newspaper. If you can, maybe consider subscribing to a few.

Without the  labor of local reporters, we wouldn't have a lot of the data we now receive from state public health authoritiesâ€”and without financial support from people who care about transparency and governance, many vital news organizations won't make it through an economic crisis. 

And thank you, from all of us on the project, for caring about this work.
